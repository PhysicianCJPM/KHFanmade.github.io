            <p>But when the real Ansem's Kingdom Hearts Encoder exploded, Riku returned to his own form.</p>
            <p>You could say it was a miracle- worked by a heart no darkness could eclipse.</p>

            <p>Goofy is a major supporting protagonist that appears in the Kingdom Hearts series. Goofy is Captain of the Royal Knights of King Mickey's court. He and Disney Castle's court magician Donald Duck went out to search for the King, and ends up teaming with Sora for the rest of their journey.</p>
            <p>Despite his position at Disney Castle, Goofy dislikes using weapons, instead using a simple shield in combat, and attempts to avoid fighting whenever possible, preferring to find peaceful solutions to problems. Though simple-minded and clumsy as always, and constantly the butt of comic relief, Goofy is the constant voice of optimism and, surprisingly, selectively perceptive, often noticing things others miss and keeping his cool when Sora and Donald lose it. True to his depiction in other Disney media, Goofy is a steadfast and reliable friend.</p>

          <p>Donald Duck is a character from the Kingdom Hearts series. In Kingdom Hearts, Donald is the Royal Magician of Disney Castle and the royal assistant for King Mickey. As such, his weapon of choice is a Staff. He often provides comic relief more than advancing the plot despite the amount of camera time he has in the series. He is rash and has an aggressive personality, but he is loyal to his friends.</p>
          <p>Though he initially only cares about Sora as a means to track down King Mickey, Donald soon grows to deeply care for him as a friend.</p>

              Sora was sent to another world called Traverse Town where all those whose worlds were eaten by the darkness goes.
              That's where Sora met Pluto, Leon, Aerith, Yuffie, and Cid. That is where Sora's first adventure began.
              Not soon after, Sora met Donald and Goofy whom were looking for their king; Mickey. Mickey told them to find the 'keybearer',
              which is Sora. They ventured worlds, there was Alice from Wonderland, Hercules, Alladin, Jack Skellington, Peter Pan, and Many more!
              They encountered creatures and friends from low and high places. And at last, they came a close to the end of their adventure when they saw Riku, Sora'
              bestfriend possessed by 'Ansem', a researcher of hearts. They beat ansem and saved kairi along with the world of all worlds from the darkness 'Ansem' was releasing from Kingdom Hearts.
              However, it is without no consequences; the sacrifice of Riku being trapped in Kingdom Hearts along with King Mickey.

              being followed by a black-hooded figure and took them to castle oblivion where they met Namine. A 'special' Nobody whom was created when Kairi
              lost her heart. After the events in Castle Oblivion, Namine's tampering with her power with memories, Sora began to forget who he was and
              who his friends were. In order to preserve his memories DiZ or better known as Ansem the wise, the true Ansem, developed a simulation to put
              Sora under suspended animation, along with Donald and Goofy to help recover his memories with the help of his Nobody Roxas.

              awake again.  Roxas broke out of the simulation and finally met his creator, Sora, stating <i>"I guess my summer vacation is over"</i>, indicating that it's time for Sora
              to be awoken again for a new adventure. Sora, Donald, and Goofy all woke up in a laboratory clueless as to why there were there in the first place. A new adventure sets in...
